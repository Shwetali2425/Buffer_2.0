# Buffer_2.0
Buffer_2.0 repo to submit your projects to.Repository containing folder-wise code for all submissions to Buffer : A Project Series, conducted between April, 2021 - June, 2020.

Each folder should contain a separate README to describe the files and project objective



Introduction :
This system is basically concerned with the 
reservation of railway tickets to the passengers.
In this we are discussing that how the reservation is 
done with the feature of cancelling and waiting list.
In the project we are going to include entities like
Reservation
Cancellation
Display reserved and waiting list passengers



OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:
 All the manual work should be converted into 
computerized so that the load of employees should 
decrease.
 The data should be stored in computer rather than in 
register manually.
 Booking can be done by sitting at your home only, no 
need to visit the booking counter


Data Structure :
Singly Linked List :
Linked List is a sequential collection of 
nodes.Which is faster than array in terms of 
deletion of nodes. It’s memory is dynamically 
allocated in runtime. This saves time and 
space.
Each node consists of four different data field :
#Name
#Age
#Registration Number
#Link to the next node

Queue :
Queue is a data structure in which 
insertion and deletion takes place from 
the ends. It follows First In First Out 
Principle.
 Queue data structure is used here to 
store the waiting list passengers. If anyone 
cancels their ticket then that seat is 
allocated to the first passenger in the 
queue.


Learnings from this project :
We learnt to solve real life problems by using 
data Structures 
Actual implementation of data structures that
we have learnt
By using technology how we can save our


What’s next for the project :
We can optimise our time complexity 
using some different data structure.
We can add features such as prioritising 
on the basis of age or railway employees 
and gender.
We can add feature of tatkal reservation.
We can provide this solution on online 
portal.
